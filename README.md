This is the Bluetooth Low Energy Web Application project I am doing for my 2024 Summer Development Internship at Medical Informatics Engineering.

app-backend is a Meteor.js web application built with React.

BLE is a node.js program that runs on devices placed throughout a clinic, sending real time location updates to the app.

All of the data storage and real-time updates is done through MongoDB, which is built into Meteor apps.
